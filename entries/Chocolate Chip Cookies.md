#Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is a simple recipe, _guaranteed_ to please your roommates.

* Preheat oven to 350 F or 350 C (it's all the same)
* Mix up ingredients (you know which ones)
* Bake for a specific amount of time (use your intuition)
* Remove from oven and immediately shove hot cookies into mouth with no hesitation.
